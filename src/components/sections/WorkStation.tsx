      Hey there! I&apos;m Hunter Macias, a software developer based in Seattle, weaving magic in tech with my fingertips. I might be a recent CS grad,
      but don&apos;t let that fool you – I&apos;ve got a rich tapestry of experiences
      under my belt. I&apos;m currently shaping young minds as a Coding Coach at TheCoder
      School, where I blend my love for Python, JavaScript, and React with a passion for
      teaching. Before this, I was the Lead Instructor at Mission Bit, where I spearheaded
      an innovative Python curriculum, guiding over 100 students through the intricacies
      of web design and Unity.
      <br />
      <br />
      But wait, there&apos;s more to my story. I&apos;ve had a thrilling stint as a Web
      Application Developer at Leadbird Agency in New York, where I developed a
      sophisticated React-based web dashboard for top executives. It was all about
      transforming complex data into intuitive insights – think Python-powered web
      scraping, Google Sheets integration, and an interactive dashboard that made data
      look sexy.
      <br />
      <br />
      My project portfolio? It&apos;s a kaleidoscope of innovation. From a music
      recommendation engine that marries machine learning with Python, to Notionary – a
      Notion-inspired web app built with Next.js and Supabase. And let&apos;s not forget
      my ChatGPT Messaging Platform, a testament to my prowess in AI, real-time messaging,
      and sleek frontend development. Evently, my event management app, combines robust
      backend development with modern UI/UX design, providing a comprehensive solution for
      event organizers and attendees alike.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I&apos;m not teaching or building, I&apos;m diving deep into technical
      proficiencies like HTML, CSS, React.js, Next.js, and database management with MySQL,
      MongoDB, and Firebase. Frameworks? Libraries? APIs? Cloud Services? You name it,
      I&apos;ve dabbled in it – always with an eye towards cutting-edge solutions and
      cloud-based efficiencies.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, if you&apos;re on the hunt for a developer who combines technical know-how with
      a flair for innovative solutions and a dash of mentorship, let&apos;s connect. You
      can DM me on Twitter or just email me. Let&apos;s create something awesome together!
